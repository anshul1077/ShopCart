# Documentation

1. HMR: Hot model replacement: Project auto-refresh. If we do any change, it will automatically reflect on the web page.
2. Package.json: Scripts contain all the commands like npm run dev. Dependencies contain list of all the modules used in our application. 
3. JSX vs JS: JSX stands for Javascript - xml. It is a way for us to write html-alike code in Javascript. Why XML? XML is a markup language like HTML which allows user defined tags.
4. React: A library to build UI. Virtual DOM, JSX, unidirectional flow of data. Fast.
5. React Fragment: We need to put all the elements inside one single element while returning.
6. React-Router-Dom: A module to help us navigate between various pages in the react application.
    - Setup the browser router in main.jsx
    - In App.jsx, Define routes and enclose in Routes tag.
    - useNavigate hook to navigate on any event.
